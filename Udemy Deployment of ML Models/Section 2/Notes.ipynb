    "__Cardinality__: cardinality is how many unique categorical variables there are. For example, a categorical feature has high cardinality if most of its values are unique. So say i have a data set and one of the columns is name. This column will have a mush higher cardinality than a column like sex because there are only 2 unique variables foe sex vs. something like name which could be different for each observation.\n",

Other models like support vector machines and neural networks do not make any variable assumptions. However a better spread of the values over a larger range tends to improve the predictive performance\n"

If feature scaling is not done, then a machine learning algorithm tends to weigh greater values, higher and consider smaller values as the lower values, regardless of the unit of the values.\n"

    "## <ins style=\"color:#f2aaaa\"> Descriptive Statistics </ins>\n",
    "Descriptive statistics is the term given to the analysis of data that helps describe, show or summarize data in a meaningful way such that, for example, patterns might emerge from the data. Descriptive statistics do not, however, allow us to make conclusions beyond the data we have analysed or reach conclusions regarding any hypotheses we might have made. They are simply a way to describe our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive statistics are very important because if we simply presented our raw data it would be hard to visualize what the data was showing, especially if there was a lot of it. Descriptive statistics therefore enables us to present the data in a more meaningful way, which allows simpler interpretation of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we had the results of 100 pieces of students' coursework, we may be interested in the overall performance of those students. We would also be interested in the distribution or spread of the marks. Descriptive statistics allow us to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Descriptive statistics are broken down into two categories. Measures of central tendency and measures of variability or spread._\n",
    "\n",
    "### <span style=\"color:#f2aaaa\"> Measures Of Central Tendency </span>\n",
    "Central tendency refers to the idea that there is one number that best summarizes the entire set of measurements, a number that is in some way “central” to the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <span style=\"color:#f2aaaa\"> Mean </span>\n",
    "Mean or Average is a central tendency of the data i.e. a number around which a whole data is spread out. In a way, it is a single number which can estimate the value of whole data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean tells you where the overall blob of data lies. For this reason, it is often referred to as a location\n",
    "parameter. If you choose to summarize the dataset with a number that is as close as possible to each data item, the mean\n",
    "is the number to choose. The mean is also a guide to what new values will look like, if you have no other information. For\n",
    "example, in the case of the bar, a new person walks in, and I must guess that person’s net worth. Then the mean is the best\n",
    "guess, because it is closest to all the data items we have already seen. In the case of the bar, if a new person walked into this bar, and you had to guess that person’s net worth, you should choose $107,903.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's calculated by taking the sum of the observations divided by the total number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu =\\dfrac {\\sum x}{n}$$\n",

    "* ${n}$ is the number of observations\n",
    " \n",
    "### <span style=\"color:#f2aaaa\"> Median </span>\n",
    "The median is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending, list of numbers and can be more descriptive of that data set than the average. The median is sometimes used as opposed to the mean when there are outliers in the sequence that might skew the average of the values.\n",

    "In this example the mode is 4 because it appears more frequently than any of the other values.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there could be a data set where there is no mode at all as all values appears same number of times. If two values appeared same time and more than the rest of the values then the data set is bimodal. If three values appeared same time and more than the rest of the values then the data set is trimodal and for n modes, that data set is multimodal.\n",

    "### <span style=\"color:#f2aaaa\"> Standard Deviation </span>\n",
    "Standard deviation is the measurement of average distance between each quantity and mean. That is, how data is spread out from mean. A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean of the data set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values.\n",

    "For an approximate answer, estimate your coefficient of variation (CV=standard deviation / mean). As a rule of thumb, a CV >= 1 indicates a relatively high variation, while a CV < 1 can be considered low.

    "In this example the coefficient of variation is less than 1, so we can assume that this data has relatively low standard deviation, and in fact it does. If we change a few of the data points to very large numbers, we can see how it effects our standard deviation and CV.\n",

    "Outliers can affect standard deviations severely, too. For our net worth data, the standard deviation without the billionaire is 9,265, but if we put the billionaire in there, it is 301,400,000. When the billionaire is in the dataset, the mean is about 91M$ and the standard deviation is about 300M—so all but one of the data items lie about a third of a standard deviation away from the mean on the small side. The other data item (the billionaire) is about three standard deviations away from the mean on the large side. In this case, the standard deviation has done its work of informing us that there are huge changes in the data, but isn’t really helpful as a description of the data.\n",

    "### <span style=\"color:#f2aaaa\"> Some Properties Histograms </span>\n",
    "The tails of a histogram are the relatively uncommon values that are significantly larger (resp. smaller) than the value at the\n",
    "peak (which is sometimes called the mode). A histogram is unimodal if there is only one peak; if there are more than one,\n",
    "it is multimodal, with the special term bimodal sometimes being used for the case where there are two peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The histograms we have seen have been relatively symmetric, where the left and right tails are about as long as one another.\n",
    "Another way to think about this is that values a lot larger than the mean are about as common as values a lot smaller than the\n",
    "mean. Not all data is symmetric. In some datasets, one or another tail is longer. This effect is called skew.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/810/1*-jZA9f5l1RaEKvPoFMz5BQ.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "One common reason (but not the only reason) is that there are actually two populations being\n",
    "conflated in the histograms. For example, measuring adult heights might result in a bimodal histogram, if male and female heights were slightly\n",
    "different. As another example, measuring the weight of dogs might result in a multimodal histogram if you did not distinguish between breeds (eg\n",
    "chihauhau, terrier, german shepherd, pyranean mountain dog, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### <span style=\"color:#f2aaaa\"> Box Plots </span>\n",
    "It is usually hard to compare multiple histograms by eye. One problem with comparing histograms is the amount of space they\n",
    "take up on a plot, because each histogram involves multiple vertical bars. This means it is hard to plot multiple overlapping\n",
    "histograms cleanly. If you plot each one on a separate figure, you have to handle a large number of separate figures; either\n",
    "you print them too small to see enough detail, or you have to keep flipping over pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "A box plot is a way to plot data that simplifies comparison. A box plot displays a dataset as a vertical picture. There is\n",
    "a vertical box whose height corresponds to the interquartile range of the data (the width is just to make the figure easy to\n",
    "interpret). Then there is a horizontal line for the median; and the behavior of the rest of the data is indicated with whiskers\n",
    "and/or outlier markers. This means that each dataset makes is represented by a vertical structure, making it easy to show\n",
    "multiple datasets on one plot and interpret the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a box plot, we first plot a box that runs from the first to the third quartile. We then show the median with a\n",
    "horizontal line. We then decide which data items should be outliers. A variety of rules are possible; for the plots I show, I\n",
    "used the rule that data items that are larger than $q_{3}+1.5\\left( q_{3}-q_{1}\\right)$ or smaller than $q_{1}-1.5\\left( q_{3}-q_{1}\\right)$, are outliers. This criterion\n",
    "looks for data items that are more than one and a half interquartile ranges above the third quartile, or more than one and a\n",
    "half interquartile ranges below the first quartile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have identified outliers, we plot these with a special symbol. We then plot whiskers,\n",
    "which show the range of non-outlier data.We draw a whisker from q1 to the smallest data item that is not an outlier, and from\n",
    "q3 to the largest data item that is not an outlier. While all this sounds complicated, any reasonable programming environment\n",
    "will have a function that will do it for you.\n",

    "correlation DOES NOT mean that changing one variable causes the other to change (sometimes known as causation).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Two variables in a dataset could be correlated for a variety of reasons. One important reason is pure accident. If you look\n",
    "at enough pairs of variables, you may well find a pair that appears to be correlated just because you have a small set of\n",
    "observations. Imagine, for example, you have a dataset consisting of only two high dimensional vectors—there is a pretty\n",
    "good chance that there is some correlation between the components. Such accidents can occur in large datasets, particularly\n",
    "if the dimensions are high.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason variables could be correlated is that there is some causal relationship—for example, pressing the\n",
    "accelerator tends to make the car go faster, and so there will be some correlation between accelerator position and car acceleration. As another example, adding fertilizer does tend to make a plant grow bigger. Imagine you record the amount of\n",
    "fertilizer you add to each pot, and the size of the resulting potplant. There should be some correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TL;DR\n",
    "Latent variables are variables that are not directly observed but are rather inferred from other variables that are observed (directly measured). This makes two variables appear to be correlated when theres really a hidden variable causing them to seem that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "__For example:__ \n",
    "in children, shoe size is correlated with reading skills. This DOES NOT mean that making your feet grow\n",
    "will make you read faster, or that you can make your feet shrink by forgetting how to read. The real issue here is the age of\n",
    "the child. Young children tend to have small feet, and tend to have weaker reading skills (because they’ve had less practice).\n",
    "Older children tend to have larger feet, and tend to have stronger reading skills (because they’ve had more practice). You\n",
    "can make a reasonable prediction of reading skills from foot size, because they’re correlated, even though there is no direct\n",
    "connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of effect can mask correlations, too. Imagine you want to study the effect of fertilizer on potplants. You collect\n",
    "a set of pots, put one plant in each, and add different amounts of fertilizer. After some time, you record the size of each\n",
    "plant. You expect to see correlation between fertilizer amount and plant size. But you might not if you had used a different\n",
    "species of plant in each pot. Different species of plant can react quite differently to the same fertilizer (some plants just die if\n",
    "over-fertilized), so the species could act as a latent variable. With an unlucky choice of the different species, you might even\n",
    "conclude that there was a negative correlation between fertilizer and plant size. This sort of thing happens often, and it’s an\n",
